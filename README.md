# Traffic Sign Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

**Type:** Academic Project for the course of *Deep Learning Neural Networks*

**Group:** Francisco Costa, Jo√£o Gouveia, Pedro Riveira, Nuno Rocha

**Programming Languages and Technologies:** Python, Tensorflow

**Objective:** Under the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project aims to answer a challenge usually faced in this growing industry: the recognition of traffic signs. With two approaches: one in which a model is built from scratch, and another using the pretrained model VGG16.

**Remarks:** The public dataset GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark ) is available on this [link](https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html). With the model built from scratch, it was achieved a precision_test and recall_test of 97%.
